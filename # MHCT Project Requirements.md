# MHCT Project Requirements

1. **Blockchain**: Implement a blockchain with the ability to add new blocks and validate the integrity of the chain.

2. **Transactions**: Implement transactions that can be added to blocks. Transactions should include the sender, recipient, and amount of MHCT.

3. **Mining**: Implement a mining process that includes a Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm.

4. **Networking**: Nodes in the blockchain network should be able to communicate with each other to add new blocks and validate transactions.

5. **Wallet**: Users should be able to create a wallet with a public and private key. The wallet should be able to generate, sign, and verify transactions.

6. **Smart Contracts**: Implement smart contracts that can be deployed to the blockchain and interacted with.

7. **Testing**: All components of the system should have corresponding tests to ensure they work as expected.

8. **Security**: Implement security measures to protect the integrity of the blockchain and the privacy of the users.
